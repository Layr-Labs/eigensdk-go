## ChainIO

This module is used to facilitate reading/writing/subscribing to [eigenlayer core](./elcontracts/) contracts and [avs registry](./avsregistry/) contracts.

To make it easier to understand the different structs in this package, and their hierarchical relationship, we describe each of them below:
- geth's ethClient
- eigensdk [ethClient](./clients/eth/client.go)
  - wraps geth's ethClient and adds convenience methods
- [eigenlayerContractBindings](./bindings/)
  - generated by abigen
  - low level bindings to eigenlayer core contracts, which wrap our ethClient
- [elContractsClient](./clients/el_contracts_client.go)
  - wraps eigenlayerContractBindings and hides a little bit of the underlying complexity, which is not needed in 99% of cases.
  - abigen also doesn't create an interface for the bindings it generates, whereas elContractsClient has a well defined interface which we use to generate mocks to help with testing.
- [ELChainReader](./elcontracts/reader.go) / [ELChainWriter](./elcontracts/writer.go) / [ELChainSubscriber](./elcontracts/subscriber.go)
  - wraps elContractsClient and adds convenience methods
  - hides even more complexity than elContractsClient
  - These structs should be the only ones used by AVS developers, apart from interacting with an ethClient directly to make direct json rpc calls such as waiting for a transaction receipt.

A similar hierarchy applies for the avs registry contracts.
