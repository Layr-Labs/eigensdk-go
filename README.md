* [Signer](./signer/README.md)
* [ChainIO](./chainio/README.md)
* [Services](./services/README.md)

## Development

```
Initialize git submodules
```

## Branches

For consistency with [eigenlayer-middleware](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware) and [eigenlayer-contracts](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts) repos, we no longer use the `master` branch and instead use `dev` as the default branch, which will track as closely as possible the `dev` branch of eigenlayer-middleware (which in turn tracks the `dev` branch of eigenlayer-contracts). This convention will also be followed for other important branches. For eg, the m2-mainnet branch of this repo will track the m2-mainnet branch of eigenlayer-middleware (which tracks the unfortunately named mainnet branch of eigenlayer-contracts), and same with the testnet-holesky branch.
